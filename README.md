### Make it yours

1. I have extract most user specific information to `_config.yml`, you should be able to set up almost everything from it.
2. Change about.md for blog intro.
3. For domain settings, see [the guide from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

### GitHub Pages stuff

The `gh-pages` branch of this repository is [the project page](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain/o), which **should not** be used as your blog, so use `master` branch for your blog. This is assuming your blog repository will be called [your-username].github.io, if this is not the case, you will need to delete the `gh-pages` repository and create a branch off the `master` branch. Hope that's clear.
